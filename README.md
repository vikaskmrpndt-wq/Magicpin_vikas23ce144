## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `composer.py` | Core message-composition logic — the `compose(category, merchant, trigger, customer=None)` function required by §7.3. Hybrid: LLM prose over a verified fact sheet, deterministic template engine as fallback. |
| `factsheet.py` | Extracts the labelled, two-tier fact sheet each message is built from, and `validate_output()` — the machine check that rejects any draft citing an unverifiable number, date, or internal term. |
| `llm_client.py` | Minimal env-driven chat client (urllib only, no new dependency) with timeout, retry/backoff, and a graceful "return nothing → fall back" contract. |
| `bot.py` | FastAPI service implementing the 5-endpoint HTTP contract from `challenge-testing-brief.md` (`/v1/context`, `/v1/tick`, `/v1/reply`, `/v1/healthz`, `/v1/metadata`, plus an optional `/v1/teardown`). |
| `conversation_handlers.py` | Optional §7.4 deliverable — a deterministic multi-turn `respond(state, message)` state machine used by `/v1/reply`. |
| `storage.py` | State store used by `bot.py` — Redis (Upstash REST API) in production, in-memory fallback for local dev. See "Deployment & state" below. |
| `api/index.py`, `vercel.json` | Vercel Python deployment entrypoint/config. |
| `submission.jsonl` | One composed message per canonical test pair in `dataset/test_pairs.json` (30 lines), each with `test_id, body, cta, send_as, suppression_key, rationale`. |
| `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile` | Deploy scaffolding (container path, if not using Vercel). |

## Approach

**Hybrid: a deterministic layer decides and verifies; an LLM only writes the prose.** Every composed message goes through the same pipeline:

1. **Deterministic trigger selection** (`bot.py` `/v1/tick`) — `_priority_score()` ranks candidate triggers by urgency, inherent business stakes, merchant-state-signal match, and category fit, with restraint floors that send nothing rather than force a weak message. (Detailed under "Decision quality" below.)
2. **Verified fact sheet** (`factsheet.py` `build_factsheet()`) — a strict, labelled list of facts pulled from the four contexts. Every field the judge is given (per `challenge-brief.md` §16 the judge gets the full dataset) is citable: merchant identity, the 30-day performance counts **and** their `delta_7d` week-on-week movement, the `category.peer_stats` benchmark for similar businesses nearby, `customer_aggregate` totals (so a derived count like "22 of your 240 patients" is grounded), `subscription` days-remaining, active-offer titles, the trigger payload, and — for a customer message — `customer.relationship` (elapsed time since last visit, visit count, services had). A short tier of **attributed facts** (review themes, a research-digest finding, the last conversation turn) is introduced with its source phrase. The one hard rule: every number, date and name must trace to a context field — nothing invented. Merchant-facing and customer-facing sheets are built differently, and a customer is never shown the merchant's performance stats.
   `_curate_hard_facts()` then narrows the ~20 available facts to the 4-6 this specific trigger kind needs, so the writer builds one point instead of dumping a dashboard.
3. **LLM prose** (`llm_client.py` + `composer._llm_compose`) — one chat call writes the message from the fact sheet and nothing else, under a system prompt that forbids inventing or relabelling any number, promising any unlisted offer, or leaking internal vocabulary.
4. **Validation** (`factsheet.validate_output`) — every draft is machine-checked: each number, price, percentage and date in the body must ground against a fact-sheet value (as a token set, so "200" is not accepted just because "1200" exists; percent/decimal equivalence handled), a semantic check catches a real number attached to the wrong metric word, a phantom-offer check catches invented freebies, a jargon blocklist rejects `ctr`/`payload`/raw field names, and a non-artifact body over ~72 words is sent back. A failing draft is retried once, then falls back.
5. **Deterministic fallback** (`composer._deterministic_compose`) — the per-trigger-kind template engine, run whenever the LLM key is absent, the call fails or times out, or a draft fails validation twice. Fully self-contained, never calls out. It stays deliberately conservative (identity + the payload facts + one active offer + a plain w/w line) so it is always safe even where the LLM path would be richer.

The reasoning:

- **Anti-fabrication is the single most heavily weighted failure mode in the rubric**, so it's prevented structurally rather than by trusting a prompt: the model is handed a closed list of facts, and the output is mechanically checked against that same list before it's allowed out. The deterministic layer, not the model, decides *what* to say and *whether* to say anything.
- **The judgement lives in the deterministic layer** — trigger ranking, the restraint floors, customer-vs-merchant fact scoping, the "no specific figure behind this alert, so don't invent one" path. These are the decisions the rubric's "decision quality" dimension rewards, and they're explicit and inspectable, not left to model discretion.
- **The LLM earns its place on fluency only** — per-category voice, natural Hindi-English code-switching (`customer.identity.language_pref` / `merchant.identity.languages`), and turning a fact sheet into two-to-four compelling sentences with one low-friction CTA.
- **Graceful degradation.** No API key, a rate-limit, a timeout, or a bad draft all resolve to the deterministic engine, so the bot can't hard-fail on an LLM hiccup during the test window. With the LLM env vars unset the bot runs deterministic-only and still satisfies the full contract.

Enable the LLM path by setting `LLM_PROVIDER` and `LLM_API_KEY` (optionally `LLM_MODEL`, default `openai/gpt-oss-120b` on Groq; `LLM_REASONING_EFFORT`, default `low`).

### Composer design

`compose()` is the hybrid entrypoint: it calls `_llm_compose()` first and returns `_deterministic_compose()` on any failure. Both return the identical contract dict (`body, cta, send_as, suppression_key, rationale`, plus an internal `ask_text`).

**The LLM path** (`_llm_compose`): build the fact sheet → render it into a system+user prompt (`_LLM_SYSTEM` carries the absolute rules; `_fs_user_prompt` lays out category/voice/taboos/reader/why-now/lever/CTA-type/artifact-flag/code-switch and the two fact tiers) → one `llm_client.chat()` call → `_clean_llm_body()` strips fences/labels → `sanitize_taboos()` → `factsheet.validate_output()`. Two attempts (the second at lower temperature with a stricter reminder); if neither validates, return `None` and let `compose()` fall back.

**The deterministic path** (`_deterministic_compose`) keeps the original two dispatch tables:

- `MERCHANT_COMPOSERS` — one function per merchant-facing trigger kind (`research_digest`, `perf_spike`, `perf_dip`, `competitor_opened`, `milestone_reached`, `festival_upcoming`, `renewal_due`, `gbp_unverified`, `supply_alert`, `active_planning_intent`, and 9 others), covering all 26 trigger kinds present in the generated dataset.
- `CUSTOMER_COMPOSERS` — one function per customer-facing kind (`recall_due`, `chronic_refill_due`, `customer_lapsed_soft/hard`, `appointment_tomorrow`, `trial_followup`, `wedding_package_followup`).

Each function returns the facts it found, a CTA, the compulsion levers it used, and a rationale. Internally the CTA is tracked at a finer grain than the API needs (`binary_yes_no`, `binary_confirm_cancel`, `multi_choice_slot`, `open_ended`) so `conversation_handlers.py` can branch on the specific ask type on a later turn — `compose()` collapses this through `normalize_cta()` to the exact contract enum (`"binary" | "open_ended" | "none"`) before it ever leaves the function, and everything also runs through a taboo-word sanitizer (`sanitize_taboos`) before returning.

**A specific finding that shaped the fallback design:** of the 100 generated trigger contexts, 75 carry only a placeholder payload (`{"placeholder": true, "metric_or_topic": "..."}`) rather than the rich payload shown in the brief's worked examples — only the original 25 seed-trigger instances (plus a few single-occurrence kinds) have full detail. Rather than let those 75 either crash or fabricate a plausible-sounding number, every composer function that depends on a specific payload field checks for its presence first and falls through to `_mf_generic` / `_cf_generic` when it's missing. Those fallbacks don't give up on specificity entirely — they pull whatever concrete fact *is* available and verifiable from the merchant, category, or customer context (a real performance delta, an active offer, a review theme, a visit count) rather than defaulting to a content-free "check out our offers!" message. We verified this by composing all 100 trigger contexts directly and scanning every output body for literal `None`, empty-string artifacts, underscore leaks, and double punctuation — zero occurrences across all 100.

### Decision quality (trigger selection in `/v1/tick`, `bot.py`)

The rubric's "decision quality" dimension asks whether the bot picks the *best* signal for the moment by combining trigger + merchant state + category fit — not whether any one composed message reads well in isolation. We treat this as primarily a selection problem, not a writing problem, and handle it in `bot.py`'s `/v1/tick`, upstream of `compose()`:

- **`_priority_score()`** scores every candidate trigger for a merchant by `urgency * 10`, plus a business-stakes boost for kinds with real downside regardless of what `urgency` says (`supply_alert`, `regulation_change`, `renewal_due`, `winback_eligible`, `competitor_opened`, `dormant_with_vera`, `gbp_unverified`), plus a bonus when the trigger kind matches a merchant-state signal we were already told about (e.g. a `dormant` signal boosts `dormant_with_vera`/`winback_eligible`; `ctr_below_peer` boosts `perf_dip`), plus a small category-fit weighting (compliance-type triggers score higher for dentists/pharmacies). A thin/placeholder-only payload is penalized. This is the "combine trigger + merchant state + category fit" the rubric names, made explicit and inspectable rather than left implicit in a template choice.
- **Restraint, twice over.** If the *best* available signal for a merchant still scores under a floor (`MIN_FIRE_SCORE` — a low-urgency, placeholder-only trigger with nothing real to say), we send nothing that tick rather than force out a content-free nudge. Separately, if a merchant already has an outbound message they haven't replied to yet (tracked via `openconv:{merchant_id}` in `storage.py`, cleared when the conversation ends), a new trigger only interrupts that thread if it clears a materially higher bar (`OPEN_CONV_OVERRIDE_SCORE`) — otherwise we hold off rather than pile a second message on an unanswered one.
- **The reasoning is visible, not just the outcome.** Every `/v1/tick` action's `rationale` states which candidates were considered, their scores, and why the winner won (e.g. *"Picked over 1 other candidate(s) this tick (curious_ask_due (score 6)); selection basis: urgency 3; 'dormant_with_vera' carries inherent business stakes (+2); matches merchant signal 'dormant' (+5)"*). `compose()` itself also prepends a one-line `Decision basis: trigger=…; merchant-state signal '…' factored in; category voice='…' honored.` to every rationale it returns (both `/v1/tick` actions and the 30 canonical `submission.jsonl` rows), so the trigger+merchant+category synthesis is explicit on every single output, not only the ones a composer function happens to narrate in prose.

### Multi-turn handling (`conversation_handlers.py`)

`respond()` is a priority-ordered regex/keyword state machine, checked in this order per turn:

1. **Auto-reply detection** (canned phrasing or verbatim repeat) — escalates send → wait (4h) → end across three consecutive occurrences, so we don't hammer an unattended inbox.
2. **Hostility** — checked *before* a calm opt-out, so "stop bothering me, this is useless spam" is correctly characterized as frustration (ending gracefully with a cooldown) rather than a mild decline.
3. **Explicit opt-out** — ends and suppresses the conversation's `suppression_key`, distinct from the hostility path.
4. **Intent transition** — the brief explicitly calls out "asking a qualifying question after the merchant has already said 'let's do it'" as an anti-pattern. We detect the commitment phrase and switch immediately to a binary CONFIRM/CANCEL ask on the already-stated next step, with no further qualifying questions. Since the prior ask (`last_offer`) is usually phrased as a question ("Want me to draft X?"), dropping it into a statement verbatim would read like a re-ask — `_as_plan()` strips the question framing so the confirmation reads as a stated plan instead ("Great — here's the plan: draft X. Reply CONFIRM...").
5. **Curveball / off-topic** — a question containing no on-topic keyword gets a polite decline and is redirected back to the single open ask, rather than answered or ignored.
6. **Generic affirmative / negative** — advances or ends against the previously stated ask.
7. **Fallback** — acknowledges and restates the single open ask, with an anti-repetition rephraser (`_dedupe`) so we never send the byte-identical body twice in one conversation.

All six of these paths, plus the escalation sequence, were exercised live against the running server (context push → tick → reply) as a final regression check before packaging this submission.

## What additional context would have helped most

- **Richer trigger payloads across the board.** As noted above, 75% of generated triggers are placeholder-only. The composer degrades gracefully, but a bot with access to the *real* metric behind e.g. `competitor_opened` or `festival_upcoming` for every instance (not just the 25 seed examples) could be meaningfully more specific and more compelling across the full trigger population, not just the seed subset.
- **A merchant's actual reply-latency/read-receipt signal.** Auto-reply detection currently relies on canned-phrase matching and verbatim-repeat detection; a real "message read" or "typing" signal from WhatsApp would let us distinguish "owner is slow" from "owner is genuinely away" more precisely than a fixed 4-hour backoff.
- **Explicit category taboo lists per category** (we inferred a taboo/sanitizer list from the brief's compliance framing for clinical categories, but an authoritative per-category list — what a dentist or pharmacy is legally not allowed to claim — would remove guesswork).
- **A shared "already said this" ledger across conversations for the same merchant**, not just within one conversation — right now `_dedupe` only prevents repeats inside a single thread; a merchant getting near-identical messages across two different triggers in the same tick window is a real risk given how sparse many trigger payloads are.

## Deployment & state

The bot runs as a Vercel Python Function (`api/index.py` re-exports the FastAPI `app` from `bot.py`). Vercel Functions have **no instance affinity across requests** — a request can land on any warm/cold instance, so the original assumption of "the process isn't restarted mid-test-window" doesn't hold there. `storage.py` accounts for this: all state (pushed contexts, conversation state, suppression keys, per-merchant send counts) is read/written through a small key-value abstraction backed by **Upstash Redis** (REST API, provisioned via the Vercel Marketplace) rather than module-level Python dicts. This was verified live — push a context, force a real cold start (15+ min idle), then confirm `/v1/healthz`'s `contexts_loaded` count is unchanged even though the instance's own `uptime_seconds` reset to near-zero.

If `KV_REST_API_URL`/`KV_REST_API_TOKEN` aren't set (e.g. plain local dev), `storage.py` falls back to an in-memory dict automatically — useful for `uvicorn bot:app` but never the path used in production.
