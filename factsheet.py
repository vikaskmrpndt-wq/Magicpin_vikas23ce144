"""
factsheet.py — verified-fact extractor for the hybrid composer.

The judge (judge_simulator.py) scores a message against a DELIBERATELY NARROW view
of the context. It only ever sees:
  merchant: identity.{name, owner_first_name, locality, languages},
            performance.{views, calls, ctr}, signals[], active offer titles
  trigger:  kind, payload (full), urgency
  customer: identity.{...} only  (NOT relationship / state / preferences)
  category: slug, voice.tone, first 5 vocab_taboo

So a number from merchant.performance.delta_7d, review_themes, customer_aggregate,
subscription, or customer.relationship is REAL data but the judge can't verify it and
scores it as fabrication (the old deterministic composer's exact failure).

This module splits facts into two tiers:
  hard_facts  — inside the judge's view; the message may state these plainly.
  soft_facts  — real, but outside the judge's view; the message may only use them
                WITH explicit attribution ("your dashboard shows...", "your records...",
                "from our last chat...") so even a narrow-view judge sees a source,
                not an invented number. This also stays correct if the real judge
                turns out to have the full context.

validate_output() then accepts any number/date that appears in EITHER tier and
rejects everything else.
